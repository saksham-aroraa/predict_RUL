# predict_RUL
This project intends to predict RUL (Remaining Useful Life) of a machine - based on Supervised Learning using various telemetry
This dataset was taken from this [example](https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/Predictive-Maintenance-Modelling-Guide-Experiment-1) which is prepared by a Microsoft Azure employee.

This project report is prepared in Matlab.
[This](https://drive.matlab.com/sharing/6fcdeed6-7480-402e-b26a-32bb5004d9aa) link can be used to view this in online mode.
The *main.mlx* file is the Live Script file used to prepare and run the project.
The *dataset.csv* is a csv file that contains the dataset.

Both the files are to be uploaded here, in the repo as well. But any changes will be reflected at matlab online prior to here.

A *.pdf* and an *.html* form (deployed at ghpages) of the .mlx file is also to be uploaded for reading convinience.

Thankyou for giving it a read :)
